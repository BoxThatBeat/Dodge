# Dodge
Small yet fun game I made on the side in game design class. The game is written in Python and is based on the pygame module. Game where you dodge randomly falling colored balls. You have three lives, and your score is recorded in the console.


To play:

Open a command console and go to directory, type 'python Dodge.py' to start the game
To move use left and right arrow keys
When you get hit, the game will pause for a second to let you know you were hit and then it will resume
After 3 hits the game will end and you can see your score on the command console
Have fun!
